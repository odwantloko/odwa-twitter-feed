Assumptions made:
1. The list of users that a person "follows" will always have a space after the comma e.g. "Ward follows Martin, Alan"
2. No 2 users will have the same name spelling in the file. Username is assumed to be the id that links different classes/potential tables
3. Processing time was too quick in milisecond to tell which tweet was create first, so I'm incrementing the time manually for the purpose of this assignment
4. The system allows users to edit their tweets
